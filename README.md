Proof-of-concept implementation of the monitoring pattern

The easiest way to test it is to run Eclipse and import the project
inside Eclipse (however it is independent of any Eclipse underlying
technology).

The main program, containing the paper tests, is MainTester in the
package examples.lambda.concrete.
